<h1>HTML</h1>

    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications. 
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. 
    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
